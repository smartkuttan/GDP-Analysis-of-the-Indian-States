GDP Analysis of the Indian States
 

 Categorise the states into four groups based on the GDP per capita (C1, C2, C3, C4, where C1 would have the highest per capita GDP and C4, the lowest). The quantile values are (0.20,0.5, 0.85, 1), i.e., the states lying between the 85th and the 100th percentile are in C1; those between the 50th and the 85th percentiles are in C2, and so on 

Plot the contribution of the sub-sectors as a percentage of the GSDP of each category

II: This section will require the dropout rate dataset apart from the dataset that you used in Part-1 of the case study. Download instructions are provided in the next segment.

 

Part-II: GDP and Education

Analyse if there is any correlation of GDP per capita with dropout rates in education (primary, upper primary and secondary) for the year 2014-2015 for each state. Choose an appropriate plot to conduct this analysis.
